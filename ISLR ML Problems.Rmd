# Chapter 2: Statistical Learning

### Question 8
```{r}
library(ISLR)
summary(College)
pairs(College[,2:6])
boxplot(College$Outstate~College$Private)
Elite<-rep("No",nrow(College))
Elite[College$Top10perc>50]<-"Yes"
Elite<-as.factor(Elite)
College<-data.frame(College,Elite)
summary(College$Elite)
boxplot(College$Outstate~College$Elite)
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
hist(College$Room.Board,breaks=25)
hist(College$Books,breaks=15)
hist(College$Apps,breaks=50)
hist(College$PhD,breaks=12)

```
  

### Question 9
  The variables Name and Origin are qualitative and the rest are quantitative.
  
```{r}
for (i in 1:7)
{cat("The range of", names(Auto)[i],"is",range(Auto[,i]),"\n")}
```
  
```{r}
for (i in 1:7)
{cat("The mean and standard deviation of",names(Auto)[i],"are",mean(Auto[,i]),"and",sd(Auto[,i]),"\n")}
```


```{r}
Auto2<-Auto[-c(10:85),]
for (i in 1:7)
{cat("Having removed the 10th through 85th rows; the range of", names(Auto2)[i],"is",range(Auto2[,i]),"\n and the mean and standard deviation of",names(Auto2)[i],"are",mean(Auto2[,i]),"and",sd(Auto2[,i]),".\n")}
```

```{r}
pairs(Auto[,1:7])
```

There appears to be strong positive linear relationships between horsepower and weight. Similarly, there is a positive approximately linear relationship between horsepower and displacement and between weight and displacement.

The predictors displacement, weight and horsepower seem to be the ones with the most obvious relationship to mpg. Each exhibits a decreasing weakly non-linear relationship with mpg.

### Question 10
   
```{r}
library(ISLR2)
cat("The number of rows in the Boston dataset is",nrow(Boston),".")

cat("The number of columns in the Boston dataset is",ncol(Boston),".")
```
The rows represent different suburbs of Boston and the columns represent various housing and area statistics for each suburb. 

```{r}
pairs(Boston[,1:6])
pairs(Boston[,7:13])
```

```{r}
par(mfrow=c(3,4))
for (i in 2:13)
{plot(Boston$crim,Boston[,i],ylab=names(Boston)[i])}
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
